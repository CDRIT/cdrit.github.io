The CDR-IT Cat (aka 'Comité per la Defensa de la República' branca tecnològica) is built to help individuals and Real Life CDRs locate information and resources in internet.

We also aim to help creators make sure their resources are not taken down by spanish police forces (currently under control of the `.cat` TLD, e.g.).

If you are a content creator and want us to mirror your content or include a link so it's locatable, open an [open an issue](https://github.com/CDRITCAT/cdritcat.github.io/issues) or mention [@cdritcat](https://twitter.com/cdritcat) in twitter.
