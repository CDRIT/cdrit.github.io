The CDR-IT Cat is an organization of volunteers to help individuals and Real World CDRs with technological issues. It is not the purpose of CDR-IT Cat to generate new tools, sites or promote particular activities. Instead we aim to help those who are non-tech savvy to avoid spanish censorship.

Some examples of our activities are the _forks_ of sites that document [spanish police brutality](https://github.com/spanishpolice/spanishpolice.github.io) or [violence by Spanish radicals](https://github.com/12kbps/spanishradicals.github.io) but we aim to help _twitter stars_ or other individuals.
